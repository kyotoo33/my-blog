# Day 1 Projects
# 第1天项目

## Morning: Spaghetti Marshmallow Challenge
## 上午：Spaghetti Marshmallow 挑战

### Challenge Results | 挑战结果

- **Team Name | 团队名称**: PulseLink
- **Final Height | 最终高度**: 45 cm
- **Did it stand for 5 seconds? | 能站立5秒吗？**: Yes
- **Rank in class | 班级排名**: 4 out of 4 teams

### Our Approach | 我们的方法

**Initial Strategy**: Sturdy Structure  
**Adaptation**: We realized we needed to be taller, but ran out of time to add significant height while maintaining stability. We focused on adding more supports.

### What We Learned | 我们学到了什么

1. **Prototyping**: Don't make towers with spaghetti (or at least, understand the material limits better).
2. **Engineering**: Triangular bases are stable; weight distribution is key.
3. **Teamwork**: We worked well together, no disagreements, everyone contributed.
4. **Time Management**: Ran out of time; planning (0 mins) vs building (20 mins) ratio could be adjusted, though we jumped straight into building.

### Arduino Code Snippet | Arduino 代码片段

Here's a code snippet from one of my challenges:

这是我某个挑战中的代码片段：

```cpp
// Add your Arduino code here
// 在这里添加你的 Arduino 代码
void setup() {
  // Your setup code
}

void loop() {
  // Your loop code
}
```
