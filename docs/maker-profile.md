## 🎯 Why I'm Here | 为什么来这里

### Why did I join the Making More Makers course? | 为什么参加 Making More Makers 课程？
Because I wanna learn more about arduino

### What do I hope to gain from this experience? | 我希望从这次经历中获得什么？
Arduino skills

## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）
Pulse link

### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

PulseLink aims to build an interactive hardware prototype that reacts to human emotional cues using multimodal sensing and mathematical modeling. It is a computationally expressive object that "breathes," "pulses," or "flows" in response to humans nearby. We will use ESP32, sensors, and applied math algorithms to create this emotional feedback loop.

### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

We want to explore how mathematics and embedded systems can create a physical object that feels "present." This project merges computational intelligence with artistic expression, using affective computing to transform raw signals into emotional state estimates expressed through light and motion.
